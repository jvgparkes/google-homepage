### What have I learned?

It is quite easy to make git commit messages too long. 50 characters; that's all. It is also quite easy to get carried away coding and realise you haven't committed for several minutes. But hey - first project. I think these skills will become second nature eventually. 

### What did I struggle with?

Well, take a look! That UK text that is supposed to stick to the Google logo? I could not work out how to get this to work as it does on the real Google homepage. I am wondering if it needs some advanced techniques I do not know about yet. Or maybe it is possible with all the layout and positioning styles, but I am struggling to get my head around these.
